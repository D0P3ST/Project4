BTreeTester:
Method: Test tree insert- This method can be used to test any insertion into the btree.
The parameters are a btree, a key for the object, and a string for the test name.

I used this to test insertion for a few different keys. If the key is inserted, the method
will return true.

Method: Test tree remove- This method is similar to the insertion method but it removes. The 
parameters are a btree, a key to be removed, and a string for the test name. I did a few of
these ass well. 

The last part of each test was to print out the btree and see if the insertion or deletion 
worked. You will have to view it and make sure that it came out correctly.

BTreeNodeTester
Method: test number insert- inserts a key value into the node.
